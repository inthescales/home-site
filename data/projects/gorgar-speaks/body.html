Gorgar Speaks was a twitter bot written in homage to <a href="https://pinside.com/pinball/machine/gorgar">Gorgar</a>, the first talking pinball machine. It tweeted sentences using Gorgar's seven word vocabulary several times per day. In November of 2022, Gorgar went to college to learn more words, and is no longer active on Twitter.
