Stock Photo Dog was a short-lived Twitter bot that listened to follower's feeds and responded to posts containing words interesting to dogs with a photo of an extremely excited dog.

Sadly, after a single day of existence it was decomissioned, and no longer operates. You can view its memorial account <a href="https://twitter.com/stock_photo_dog">on Twitter</a>.
