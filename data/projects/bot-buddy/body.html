Bot Buddy is a small python module to assist in scheduling and networking for Twitter bots.
<br><br>
Currently it is able to:
<ul>
    <li>Post to twitter, using the output of your own code, on a regular schedule</li>
    <li>Accept a time to start tweeting, or round to the nearest period</li>
    <li>Run in a test mode to see sample output without posting</li>
</ul>
You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/mumbler/bot-buddy">here on Github</a>.
